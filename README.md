# Monte Carlo -S- 1D 2D 3D

In this section we use again Monte Carlo Simulation  to calculate the mean of S, where S is sum of the positions that the particle visited once at least. 
We use the same time steps like simulation of calculating  mean square distance and also we use boundary conditions for the box simulation. 
Finally we write again as a data file, the means of S as y value and time step as x value and we create a graph in matlab enviroment.
